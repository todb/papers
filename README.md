# Tod's papers stash

This is where I'll stash papers if the primary URL disappears out from under me.

Note that for most (well, currently, all) of the papers in here, I don't actually hold the
copyright to -- they were work for hire. If you'd like to reprint them, you should
talk to the copyright holders. But, they were, at least at one point, widely
distributed, and sometimes cited according to my
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SbB2geMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) profile,
so I figured I may as well keep a backup.
